3D-File-Browser
===============

A 3D File Browser in Java with JMonkey. Inspired by the movie Jurassic Park and the use of FSN(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fsn). IT'S A UNIX 
SYSTEM! (except when this runs on Windows)

Allows a user to "walk through" their filesystem, as well as blow up files with the space bar (doesn't actually delete by default). Clicking on a directory drills down into that directory and redraws.
